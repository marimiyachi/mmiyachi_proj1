# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#0.upto(250).each { |x| Site.create(:count => (rand(50))) }

sites = Site.create(:count => 20)
#sites.pages.create(title: "Test", visit_count: 1)
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
